Send a log of activity from Aha! to a Slack channel. Configure the integration for a product to send only activity for that product. Configure the integration for the account to send all activity that you have access to.

**WARNING** Sending activity out of Aha! and into Slack bypasses the security controls in Aha!. Anyone who has access to your Slack channel will be able to see the activity, regardless of whether they have access to that information in Aha!

## Configuration

1. Click on the _Add to Slack_ button. This will take you to Slack to choose which channel Aha! activities should appear in.
2. Click the _Test connection_ button. After a short delay you should see a message appear in your Slack client in the channel you selected.
3. Enable the integration.
4. Consider renaming this integration with your slack channel name for easy future reference. Perhaps something like: "Slack: #customers." You can do this by clicking the _Slack_ text in the heading of this page.
