The Salesforce integration allows users in Salesforce to create new ideas in Aha! from Salesforce opportunities and cases. 

This integration allows Aha! to communicate to Salesforce to create links between Salesforce records and Aha! ideas. The integration also allows Aha! to update Salesforce when ideas are modified in Aha! - changes to the name of an idea or the status of an idea will immediately update Salesforce.

## Configuration

You need to be a Administrator in Aha! to set up this integration.

1. Add the integration under _Account Settings_ (the Salesforce integration is for the entire Aha! account).
2. Enter your Salesforce credentials.
3. Click the _Test connection_ button to verify your credentials are correct.
4. Enable the integration.

To use the integration you must also install the Aha! app within your Salesforce account. Use the [installation instructions](http://support.aha.io/hc/en-us/articles/203880429) to get the app installed.
