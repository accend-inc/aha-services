Our Zendesk app is pending approval in the Zendesk Marketplace. When it is approved you will be able to follow these instructions to install it.

To use the Zendesk app you must:

* Have at least the Contributor role for for the products that you want to submit ideas to.
* Have the Administrator role in your Aha! account.

The app will use one user account within Aha! for all Zendesk agents - so there is no need to have an Aha! user for each agent.

The Zendesk app is configured within Zendesk:

1. In your Zendesk agent interface, navigate to the _Apps Marketplace_.
2. Find and install the Aha! app.
